Practice Exercises for Functions

Solve each of the practice exercises below. Each problem includes three CodeSkulptor links: one for a template that you should use as a starting point for your solution, one to our solution to the exercise, and one to a tool that automatically checks your solution.

Write a Python function 𝚝𝚘𝚝𝚊𝚕_𝚜𝚎𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚍𝚜 that takes three parameters 𝚑𝚘𝚞𝚛𝚜, 𝚖𝚒𝚗𝚞𝚝𝚎𝚜 and 𝚜𝚎𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚍𝚜 and returns the total number of seconds for 𝚑𝚘𝚞𝚛𝚜 hours, 𝚖𝚒𝚗𝚞𝚝𝚎𝚜 minutes and 𝚜𝚎𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚍𝚜 seconds. Hours to seconds template --- Hours to seconds solution --- Hours to seconds (Checker)
Write a Python function 𝚛𝚎𝚌𝚝𝚊𝚗𝚐𝚕𝚎_𝚙𝚎𝚛𝚒𝚖𝚎𝚝𝚎𝚛 that takes two parameters 𝚠𝚒𝚍𝚝𝚑 and 𝚑𝚎𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝 corresponding to the lengths of the sides of a rectangle and returns the perimeter of the rectangle in inches. Perimeter of rectangle template --- Perimeter of rectangle solution --- Perimeter of rectangle (Checker)
Write a Python function 𝚛𝚎𝚌𝚝𝚊𝚗𝚐𝚕𝚎_𝚊𝚛𝚎𝚊 that takes two parameters 𝚠𝚒𝚍𝚝𝚑 and 𝚑𝚎𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝 corresponding to the lengths of the sides of a rectangle and returns the area of the rectangle in square inches. Area of rectangle template --- Area of rectangle solution --- Area of rectangle (Checker)
Write a Python function 𝚌𝚒𝚛𝚌𝚕𝚎_𝚌𝚒𝚛𝚌𝚞𝚖𝚏𝚎𝚛𝚎𝚗𝚌𝚎 that takes a single parameter 𝚛𝚊𝚍𝚒𝚞𝚜 corresponding to the radius of a circle in inches and returns the the circumference of a circle with radius 𝚛𝚊𝚍𝚒𝚞𝚜 in inches. Do not use π=3.14, instead use the 𝚖𝚊𝚝𝚑 module to supply a higher-precision approximation to π. Circumference of circle template --- Circumference of circle solution --- Circumference of circle (Checker)
Write a Python function 𝚌𝚒𝚛𝚌𝚕𝚎_𝚊𝚛𝚎𝚊 that takes a single parameter 𝚛𝚊𝚍𝚒𝚞𝚜 corresponding to the radius of a circle in inches and returns the the area of a circle with radius 𝚛𝚊𝚍𝚒𝚞𝚜 in square inches. Do not use π=3.14, instead use the 𝚖𝚊𝚝𝚑 module to supply a higher-precision approximation to π. Area of circle template --- Area of circle solution --- Area of circle (Checker)
Write a Python function 𝚏𝚞𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚎_𝚟𝚊𝚕𝚞𝚎 that takes three parameters 𝚙𝚛𝚎𝚜𝚎𝚗𝚝_𝚟𝚊𝚕𝚞𝚎, 𝚊𝚗𝚗𝚞𝚊𝚕_𝚛𝚊𝚝𝚎 and 𝚢𝚎𝚊𝚛𝚜 and returns the future value of 𝚙𝚛𝚎𝚜𝚎𝚗𝚝_𝚟𝚊𝚕𝚞𝚎 dollars invested at 𝚊𝚗𝚗𝚞𝚊𝚕_𝚛𝚊𝚝𝚎 percent interest, compounded annually for 𝚢𝚎𝚊𝚛𝚜 years. Future value template --- Future value solution --- Future value (Checker)
Write a Python function 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎_𝚝𝚊𝚐 that takes as input the parameters 𝚏𝚒𝚛𝚜𝚝_𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎 and 𝚕𝚊𝚜𝚝_𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎 (strings) and returns a string of the form "𝙼𝚢 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎 𝚒𝚜 % %." where the percents are the strings 𝚏𝚒𝚛𝚜𝚝_𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎 and 𝚕𝚊𝚜𝚝_𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎. Reference the test cases in the provided template for an exact description of the format of the returned string. Name tag template --- Name tag solution --- Name tag (Checker)
Write a Python function 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎_𝚊𝚗𝚍_𝚊𝚐𝚎 that takes as input the parameters 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎 (a string) and 𝚊𝚐𝚎 (a number) and returns a string of the form "% 𝚒𝚜 % 𝚢𝚎𝚊𝚛𝚜 𝚘𝚕𝚍." where the percents are the string forms of 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎 and 𝚊𝚐𝚎. Reference the test cases in the provided template for an exact description of the format of the returned string. Name and age template --- Name and age solution --- Name and age (Checker)
Write a Python function 𝚙𝚘𝚒𝚗𝚝_𝚍𝚒𝚜𝚝𝚊𝚗𝚌𝚎 that takes as the parameters 𝚡𝟶, 𝚢𝟶, 𝚡𝟷 and 𝚢𝟷, and returns the distance between the points (x0,y0) and (x1,y1). Point distance template --- Point distance solution --- Point distance (Checker)
Challenge: Write a Python function 𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚊𝚗𝚐𝚕𝚎_𝚊𝚛𝚎𝚊 that takes the parameters 𝚡𝟶, 𝚢𝟶, 𝚡𝟷,𝚢𝟷, 𝚡𝟸, and 𝚢𝟸, and returns the area of the triangle with vertices (x0,y0), (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). (Hint: use the function 𝚙𝚘𝚒𝚗𝚝_𝚍𝚒𝚜𝚝𝚊𝚗𝚌𝚎 as a helper function and apply Heron's formula.) Triangle area template --- Triangle area solution --- Triangle area (Checker)
Challenge: Write a Python function 𝚙𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚝_𝚍𝚒𝚐𝚒𝚝𝚜 that takes an integer 𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛 in the range [0,100), i.e., at least 0, but less than 100. It prints the message "𝚃𝚑𝚎 𝚝𝚎𝚗𝚜 𝚍𝚒𝚐𝚒𝚝 𝚒𝚜 %, 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚘𝚗𝚎𝚜 𝚍𝚒𝚐𝚒𝚝 𝚒𝚜 %.", where the percent signs should be replaced with the appropriate values. (Hint: Use the arithmetic operators for integer division // and remainder % to find the two digits. Note that this function should print the desired message, rather than returning it as a string. Print digits template --- Print digits solution --- Print digits (Checker)
Challenge: Powerball is lottery game in which 6 numbers are drawn at random. Players can purchase a lottery ticket with a specific number combination and, if the number on the ticket matches the numbers generated in a random drawing, the player wins a massive jackpot. Write a Python function 𝚙𝚘𝚠𝚎𝚛𝚋𝚊𝚕𝚕 that takes no arguments and prints the message "𝚃𝚘𝚍𝚊𝚢'𝚜 𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛𝚜 𝚊𝚛𝚎 %, %, %, %, 𝚊𝚗𝚍 %. 𝚃𝚑𝚎 𝙿𝚘𝚠𝚎𝚛𝚋𝚊𝚕𝚕 𝚗𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛 𝚒𝚜 %.". The first five numbers should be random integers in the range [1,60), i.e., at least 1, but less than 60. In reality, these five numbers must all be distinct, but for this problem, we will allow duplicates. The Powerball number is a random integer in the range [1,36), i.e., at least 1 but less than 36. Use the 𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚘𝚖 module and the function 𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚘𝚖.𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚛𝚊𝚗𝚐𝚎 to generate the appropriate random numbers.Note that this function should print the desired message, rather than returning it as a string. Powerball template --- Powerball solution --- Powerball (Checker)
