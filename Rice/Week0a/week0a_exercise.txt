Practice Exercises for Expressions

Solve each of the practice exercises below. Each problem includes three CodeSkulptor links: one for a template that you should use as a starting point for your solution, one to our solution to the exercise, and one to a tool that automatically checks your solution.

There are 5280 feet in a mile. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the number of feet in 13 miles. Miles to feet template --- Miles to feet solution --- Miles to feet (Checker)
Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the number of seconds in 7 hours, 21 minutes and 37 seconds.Hours to seconds template --- Hours to seconds solution --- Hours to seconds (Checker)
The perimeter of a rectangle is 2w+2h, where w and h are the lengths of its sides. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the length in inches of the perimeter of a rectangle with sides of length 4 and 7 inches. Perimeter of rectangle template ---Perimeter of rectangle solution --- Perimeter of rectangle (Checker)
The area of a rectangle is wh, where w and h are the lengths of its sides. Note that the multiplication operation is not shown explicitly in this formula. This is standard practice in mathematics, but not in programming. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the area in square inches of a rectangle with sides of length 4 and 7 inches. Area of rectangle template Area of rectangle solution Area of rectangle (Checker)
The circumference of a circle is 2πr where r is the radius of the circle. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the circumference in inches of a circle whose radius is 8 inches. Assume that the constant π=3.14. Circumference of circle template --- Circumference of circle solution --- Circumference of circle (Checker)
The area of a circle is πr2 where r is the radius of the circle. (The raised 2 in the formula is an exponent.) Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the area in square inches of a circle whose radius is 8 inches. Assume that the constant π=3.14. Area of circle template --- Area of circle solution --- Area of circle (Checker)
Given p dollars, the future value of this money when compounded yearly at a rate of r percent interest for y years is p(1+0.01r)y. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the value of 1000 dollars compounded at 7 percent interest for 10 years. Future value template --- Future value solution --- Future value (Checker)
Write a single Python statement that combines the three strings "𝙼𝚢 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎 𝚒𝚜", "𝙹𝚘𝚎" and "𝚆𝚊𝚛𝚛𝚎𝚗" (plus a couple of other small strings) into one larger string "𝙼𝚢 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎 𝚒𝚜 𝙹𝚘𝚎 𝚆𝚊𝚛𝚛𝚎𝚗." and prints the result. Name tag template --- Name tag solution --- Name tag (Checker)
Write a Python expression that combines the string "𝙹𝚘𝚎 𝚆𝚊𝚛𝚛𝚎𝚗 𝚒𝚜 𝟻𝟸 𝚢𝚎𝚊𝚛𝚜 𝚘𝚕𝚍." from the string "𝙹𝚘𝚎 𝚆𝚊𝚛𝚛𝚎𝚗" and the number 52 and then prints the result (Hint: Use the function 𝚜𝚝𝚛 to convert the number into a string.) Name and age template --- Name and age solution --- Name and age (Checker)
The distance between two points (x0,y0) and (x1,y1) is (x0−x1)2+(y0−y1)2‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the distance between the points (2,2) and (5,6). Point distance template --- Point distance solution --- Point distance (Checker)
