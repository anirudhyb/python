Practice Exercises for Variables and Assignments

Solve each of the practice exercises below. Each problem includes three CodeSkulptor links: one for a template that you should use as a starting point for your solution, one to our solution to the exercise, and one to a tool that automatically checks your solution.

Given a template that pre-defines a variable 𝚖𝚒𝚕𝚎𝚜, write an assignment statement that defines a variable 𝚏𝚎𝚎𝚝 whose value is the number of feet in 𝚖𝚒𝚕𝚎𝚜 miles. Miles to feet template --- Miles to feet solution --- Miles to feet (Checker)
Given a template that pre-defines three variables 𝚑𝚘𝚞𝚛𝚜, 𝚖𝚒𝚗𝚞𝚝𝚎𝚜 and 𝚜𝚎𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚍𝚜, write an assignment statement that updates the variable 𝚝𝚘𝚝𝚊𝚕_𝚜𝚎𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚍𝚜 to have a value corresponding to the total number of seconds for 𝚑𝚘𝚞𝚛𝚜 hours, 𝚖𝚒𝚗𝚞𝚝𝚎𝚜 minutes and 𝚜𝚎𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚍𝚜 seconds. Hours to second template --- Hours to second solution --- Hours to second (Checker)
Given a template that pre-defines the variables 𝚠𝚒𝚍𝚝𝚑 and 𝚑𝚎𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝 that are the lengths of the sides of a rectangle, write an assignment statement that defines a variable 𝚙𝚎𝚛𝚒𝚖𝚎𝚝𝚎𝚛 whose value is the perimeter of the rectangle in inches. Perimeter of rectangle template --- Perimeter of rectangle solution --- Perimeter of rectangle (Checker)
Given a template that pre-defines the variables 𝚠𝚒𝚍𝚝𝚑 and 𝚑𝚎𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝 that are the lengths of the sides of a rectangle, write an assignment statement that defines a variable 𝚊𝚛𝚎𝚊 whose value is the area of the rectangle in square inches. Area of rectangle template --- Area of rectangle solution --- Area of rectangle (Checker)
Given a template that pre-defines the constant 𝙿𝙸 and the variable 𝚛𝚊𝚍𝚒𝚞𝚜 corresponding to the radius of a circle in inches, write an assignment statement that defines a variable 𝚌𝚒𝚛𝚌𝚞𝚖𝚏𝚎𝚛𝚎𝚗𝚌𝚎 whose value is the circumference of a circle with radius 𝚛𝚊𝚍𝚒𝚞𝚜 in inches. Circumference of circle template --- Circumference of circle solution --- Circumference of circle (Checker)
Given a template that pre-defines the constant 𝙿𝙸 and the variable 𝚛𝚊𝚍𝚒𝚞𝚜 corresponding to the radius of a circle in inches, write an assignment statement that defines a variable 𝚊𝚛𝚎𝚊 whose value is the area of a circle with radius 𝚛𝚊𝚍𝚒𝚞𝚜 in square inches.Area of circle template --- Area of circle solution --- Area of circle (Checker)
Given the pre-defined variables 𝚙𝚛𝚎𝚜𝚎𝚗𝚝_𝚟𝚊𝚕𝚞𝚎, 𝚊𝚗𝚗𝚞𝚊𝚕_𝚛𝚊𝚝𝚎 and 𝚢𝚎𝚊𝚛𝚜, write an assignment statement that define a variable 𝚏𝚞𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚎_𝚟𝚊𝚕𝚞𝚎 whose value is 𝚙𝚛𝚎𝚜𝚎𝚗𝚝_𝚟𝚊𝚕𝚞𝚎 dollars invested at 𝚊𝚗𝚗𝚞𝚊𝚕_𝚛𝚊𝚝𝚎 percent interest, compounded annually for 𝚢𝚎𝚊𝚛𝚜 years. Future value template --- Future value solution --- Future value (Checker)
Give the pre-defined variables 𝚏𝚒𝚛𝚜𝚝_𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎 and 𝚕𝚊𝚜𝚝_𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎, write an assignment statement that defines the variable 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎_𝚝𝚊𝚐 whose value is the string "My name is % %." where the percents should be replaced by 𝚏𝚒𝚛𝚜𝚝_𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎 and 𝚕𝚊𝚜𝚝_𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎. Note that, in Python, you can use the + operator on strings to concatenate (i.e. join) them together into a single string. Name tag template --- Name tag solution --- Name tag (Checker)
Given the pre-defined variables 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎 (a string) and 𝚊𝚐𝚎 (a number), write an assignment statement that defines a variable 𝚜𝚝𝚊𝚝𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝 whose value is the string "% 𝚒𝚜 % 𝚢𝚎𝚊𝚛𝚜 𝚘𝚕𝚍." where the percents should be replaced by 𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎 and the string form of 𝚊𝚐𝚎. Name and age template --- Name and age solution --- Name and age (Checker)
Given the variables 𝚡𝟶, 𝚢𝟶, 𝚡𝟷, and 𝚢𝟷, write an assignment statement that defines a variable 𝚍𝚒𝚜𝚝𝚊𝚗𝚌𝚎 whose values is the distance between the points (x0,y0) and (x1,y1). Point distance template --- Point distance solution --- Point distance (Checker)
Challenge: Heron's formulastates the area of a triangle is s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c)‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√ where a, b and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle and s=12(a+b+c) is thesemi-perimeterof the triangle. Given the variables 𝚡𝟶, 𝚢𝟶, 𝚡𝟷,𝚢𝟷, 𝚡𝟸, and 𝚢𝟸, write a Python program that computes a variable 𝚊𝚛𝚎𝚊 whose value is the area of the triangle with vertices (x0,y0), (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). (Hint: our solution uses five assignment statements.) Triangle area template --- Triangle area solution --- Triangle area (Checker)
